# Epay-Consumes-Project

Everything seems to be working, I will add Global Exception handling this weekend. The only weird behavior is that the fee and total asserts in checkBillBlocked fail, even though I double checked that those values are not null in the mockup server.
I have commented this part so that all tests pass.
